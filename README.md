# Futuristic

An awesome and simple way to do Future programming on Java 1.8. 

Futuristic allows you develop from scratch or convert existing Callback-based programs to Future-based. This will help
 you as to forget about the Callback hell and at the same time create beautiful, robust and readable code.

Futuristic was inspired in the Promises of AngularJS.

## Components

Futuristic is divided into several components so you can use what its best for your project

- [Futuristic Core](futuristic-core/): Core components of Futuristic. These are the building blocks that will enable
you to do Future-based programming in a really easy way.

- [Futuristic Http](futuristic-http/): A wrapper for any http client. This will enable you to convert **any** http client
to be Future-based. Additionally, **futuristic-http** defines a lightweight http-client framework that is engine agnostic.
This means you can switch http engines at any point without having to change anything on your code.

- [Futuristic Http Ning](futuristic-http-ning/): The awesome [Ning Http Async Client](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client)
ready to use with Futuristic

- [Futuristic Http Gson](futuristic-http-gson/): A very useful Http Client that will convert responses into gson 
automatically.
